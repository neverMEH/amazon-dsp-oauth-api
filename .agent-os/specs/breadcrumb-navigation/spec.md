# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Breadcrumb Navigation
> Created: 2025-09-14
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement breadcrumb navigation that provides hierarchical navigation path from any page back to the dashboard. This feature will enhance user experience by providing clear context of their current location within the application and enabling quick navigation to parent pages.

## User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to see where I am in the application hierarchy so I can understand my current context
- **As a user**, I want to click on breadcrumb items to quickly navigate to parent pages without using the back button
- **As a user**, I want breadcrumb navigation to work consistently across all pages and devices
- **As a user**, I want the breadcrumb navigation to be accessible and work with keyboard navigation

## Spec Scope

- Display breadcrumbs on all non-dashboard pages (Account, Settings, etc.)
- Each breadcrumb should be clickable and navigate to the respective page
- Show current page as the last breadcrumb (non-clickable)
- Use consistent styling across all pages
- Mobile-responsive design that adapts to smaller screens
- Create a reusable BreadcrumbNav component
- Integrate with React Router for navigation
- Support dynamic breadcrumb generation based on route
- Implement proper accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Out of Scope

- Breadcrumb customization or theming options
- Advanced breadcrumb features like dropdown menus for deep hierarchies
- Breadcrumb history or bookmarking functionality
- Integration with external navigation systems

## Expected Deliverable

A fully functional breadcrumb navigation system that:
- Provides clear hierarchical navigation context
- Works seamlessly across all application pages
- Is mobile-responsive and accessible
- Integrates cleanly with existing React Router setup
- Maintains consistent visual design with the application
