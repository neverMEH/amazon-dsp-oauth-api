## Implementation Notes

### Testing Strategy
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Aim for >90% test coverage across all components
- Include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
- Use pytest for FastAPI backend testing
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for frontend testing

### Security Considerations
- All tokens must be encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Implement proper OAuth state parameter validation
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Follow OWASP security best practices

### Performance Requirements
- API response times <500ms for standard operations
- Token refresh operations <2 seconds
- Frontend page load times <3 seconds
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring
- User-friendly error messages in frontend
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Documentation Requirements
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Frontend component documentation
- Deployment and operations guide
- Security and troubleshooting documentation
