# Spec Summary (Lite)

Replace the generic "Sync from Amazon" functionality with account-type-specific OAuth flows that allow users to connect Sponsored Ads accounts via "Add Sponsored Ads" button and DSP advertisers via "Add DSP Advertiser" button. Connected accounts persist locally in the database without automatic re-synchronization and can be deleted through the UI when no longer needed.
