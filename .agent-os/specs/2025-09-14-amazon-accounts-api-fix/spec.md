> Spec: Amazon Accounts API Fix and Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-14

## Overview

Fix and enhance the Amazon Advertising accounts feature to correctly retrieve account data from Amazon's API, properly store it in Supabase, and provide comprehensive visualization in the dashboard. This will enable users to seamlessly connect, manage, and monitor their Amazon advertising accounts with accurate data synchronization.

## User Stories

### Account Connection and Synchronization

As an advertising consultant, I want to connect my Amazon Advertising accounts and see all my managed accounts properly synchronized, so that I can manage multiple client accounts from a single dashboard.

The user initiates OAuth authentication, grants permissions, and the system retrieves all advertising accounts including DSP and sponsored ads accounts. The accounts are stored in Supabase with proper encryption for tokens and the dashboard displays the complete account hierarchy with real-time status updates. This solves the problem of manual account switching and provides centralized account management.

### Account Data Visualization

As a brand manager, I want to see comprehensive account information in the dashboard including account status, marketplace details, and synchronization health, so that I can quickly identify issues and monitor account performance.

The dashboard displays account cards with status indicators, last sync timestamps, marketplace information, and quick actions. Users can filter accounts by status, type, or marketplace, and perform batch operations. This eliminates the need to check multiple Amazon interfaces and provides instant visibility into account health.

### Automated Token Management

As a user, I want the system to automatically manage my authentication tokens without manual intervention, so that I never experience authentication failures during critical reporting periods.

The system implements proactive token refresh, automatically refreshing tokens 10 minutes before expiration. It includes proper error handling for token failures and maintains token encryption at rest. This solves authentication interruptions that previously required manual re-authentication.

## Spec Scope

1. **Fix API Integration Issues** - Correct the Account Management API implementation to use proper POST method with correct content-type headers
2. **Implement Pagination Support** - Add full pagination for both accounts and profiles endpoints to handle large account sets
3. **Enhance Rate Limiting** - Implement exponential backoff with proper retry logic for Amazon API rate limits
4. **Proactive Token Refresh** - Add background scheduler to refresh tokens before expiration
5. **Comprehensive Dashboard Visualization** - Create account management UI with filtering, sorting, and batch operations

## Out of Scope

- DSP campaign creation and management
- Detailed performance reporting and analytics
- Account registration for new Amazon advertisers
- Billing and payment processing
- Custom API integrations beyond Amazon Advertising

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully functional account synchronization that correctly retrieves and stores all Amazon advertising accounts with proper pagination
2. Dashboard interface displaying all synchronized accounts with real-time status, filtering capabilities, and batch operations
3. Automated token management system that prevents authentication failures through proactive refresh
