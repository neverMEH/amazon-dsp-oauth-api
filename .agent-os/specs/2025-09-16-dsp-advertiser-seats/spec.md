# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: DSP Advertiser Seats Management
> Created: 2025-09-16

## Overview

Implement DSP advertiser seats functionality to display seat allocations across advertising exchanges within the accounts section. This feature will enable users to view and manage their DSP advertiser seats information, providing transparency into exchange-specific seat identifiers used for deal creation and spend tracking.

## User Stories

### DSP Advertiser Seat Visibility

As a DSP advertiser, I want to view my seat allocations across all advertising exchanges, so that I can understand my buying capacity and manage my programmatic deals effectively.

The user navigates to the Accounts section, selects the DSP tab, and views a comprehensive list of their advertiser seats organized by exchange. Each seat displays the exchange name, unique identifiers for deal creation and spend tracking, allowing the advertiser to reference these IDs when setting up programmatic deals or troubleshooting campaign delivery issues.

### Exchange-Specific Seat Filtering

As a DSP campaign manager, I want to filter seat information by specific exchanges, so that I can focus on the platforms most relevant to my current campaigns.

From the DSP seats interface, the user applies filters to view seats from specific exchanges (e.g., Google Ad Manager, Amazon Publisher Services). The filtered view updates dynamically, showing only the seats for selected exchanges with pagination support for accounts with many seat allocations.

### Seat Information Synchronization

As an account administrator, I want the seat information to automatically sync with Amazon DSP, so that I always have current seat allocation data without manual updates.

The system automatically refreshes seat data when the user accesses the DSP section, with visual indicators showing the last sync time. If seats have changed since the last visit, the interface highlights new or modified seat allocations, ensuring users are aware of any changes to their exchange access.

## Spec Scope

1. **DSP Seats API Integration** - Implement Amazon DSP Seats API endpoint to retrieve advertiser seat allocations across exchanges
2. **Database Schema Extension** - Add support for storing seat information including exchange details and seat identifiers
3. **Frontend DSP Tab** - Create a dedicated DSP sub-page within the accounts section displaying seat information with filtering capabilities
4. **Automatic Data Synchronization** - Implement background refresh of seat data with timestamp tracking and change detection
5. **Pagination and Filtering** - Support for handling large seat datasets with exchange-based filtering and pagination

## Out of Scope

- Creating new advertiser seats through the API
- Modifying existing seat configurations
- Direct integration with exchange platforms
- Seat performance metrics or spend tracking
- Bulk seat management operations
- Historical seat allocation tracking

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional DSP tab in the accounts section displaying advertiser seats with exchange information, seat IDs, and sync status
2. Working API endpoint that successfully retrieves seat data from Amazon DSP with proper authentication and error handling
3. Database properly storing and updating seat information with efficient retrieval for frontend display
