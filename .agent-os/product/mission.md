# Product Mission

## Pitch

Amazon Ads Reporting Platform is a comprehensive analytics and reporting solution that helps advertising professionals and brands gain deep insights into their Amazon advertising performance by providing automated OAuth authentication, DSP campaign insights, and AMC reporting capabilities through a unified dashboard.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Independent Consultants**: Advertising professionals managing multiple brand accounts who need streamlined reporting
- **Brand Managers**: Marketing teams requiring detailed performance analytics for Amazon advertising campaigns
- **Agency Teams**: Digital agencies managing Amazon advertising for multiple clients

### User Personas

**Advertising Analyst** (28-45 years old)
- **Role:** Amazon Advertising Specialist/Consultant
- **Context:** Managing advertising campaigns for multiple brands on Amazon's ecosystem
- **Pain Points:** Manual report generation is time-consuming, difficulty accessing AMC data, token management complexity
- **Goals:** Automate reporting workflows, provide actionable insights to clients, centralize campaign data

## The Problem

### Complex API Authentication

Managing OAuth tokens for Amazon Advertising APIs requires constant manual intervention and technical expertise. This results in 2-3 hours weekly spent on authentication issues alone.

**Our Solution:** Automated token refresh system with encrypted storage ensures uninterrupted API access.

### Fragmented Reporting Ecosystem

DSP campaigns, AMC reports, and standard advertising data live in separate systems, requiring manual consolidation. Brands lose 10-15 hours monthly compiling comprehensive reports.

**Our Solution:** Unified dashboard integrating DSP Campaign Insights and AMC Reporting APIs for holistic performance views.

### Limited AMC Access

Setting up and querying Amazon Marketing Cloud requires SQL expertise and manual workflow creation. 80% of advertisers underutilize AMC due to technical barriers.

**Our Solution:** Simplified AMC administration interface with pre-built query templates and automated report generation.

## Differentiators

### Automated Token Management

Unlike manual OAuth implementations, we provide zero-maintenance token refresh with military-grade encryption. This results in 100% uptime for API connections and elimination of authentication-related disruptions.

### Integrated Multi-API Reporting

While competitors focus on single API endpoints, we seamlessly integrate DSP Campaign Insights, AMC Administration, and AMC Reporting. This delivers 75% faster report generation compared to manual methods.

### Privacy-First Architecture

Unlike cloud-based solutions, we use local encryption with Fernet and Supabase for data sovereignty. This ensures complete control over sensitive advertising data and compliance with enterprise security requirements.
