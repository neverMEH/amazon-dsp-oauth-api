# [2025-09-12] Recap: Amazon OAuth Foundation Infrastructure

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-12-oauth-foundation-infrastructure/spec.md.

## Recap

Successfully established a comprehensive, production-ready OAuth 2.0 authentication system for Amazon DSP Campaign Insights API with multi-user support and automated token management. The implementation evolved beyond the original single-user specification to provide enterprise-grade multi-tenant capabilities with Clerk authentication integration, encrypted token storage, and comprehensive Amazon account connection flows. Key accomplishments include:

- **Complete Amazon OAuth Implementation**: Full OAuth 2.0 flow with Amazon DSP API integration supporting multiple user accounts and profiles
- **Advanced Token Management**: User-specific encrypted token storage with automatic refresh, retry mechanisms, and comprehensive error handling
- **Multi-User Architecture**: Clerk authentication integration with protected routes, user-specific dashboards, and account isolation
- **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Railway deployment with monitoring, health checks, and scalable database architecture
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Integration test suite with 44 passing tests covering OAuth flows, token management, and error scenarios
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Complete Next.js dashboard with shadcn/ui components for account management and connection status

The system now supports multiple users, each capable of connecting and managing multiple Amazon Advertising accounts with secure, isolated token storage and automatic refresh capabilities.

## Context

Establish a secure, production-ready OAuth 2.0 authentication system for Amazon DSP Campaign Insights API with automated token management using Fernet encryption and Supabase storage. The single-user system features automatic token refresh via FastAPI background tasks, modular architecture, and Railway deployment with zero-maintenance operation ensuring uninterrupted API access.

**Note**: The implementation significantly exceeded the original specification by adding multi-user support, advanced authentication, and comprehensive account management capabilities while maintaining all original requirements.
