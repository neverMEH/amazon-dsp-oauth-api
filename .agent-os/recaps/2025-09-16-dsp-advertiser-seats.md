## User Stories Fulfilled

### ✅ DSP Advertiser Seat Visibility
Users can now navigate to the Accounts section, select the DSP tab, and view a comprehensive list of their advertiser seats organized by exchange. Each seat displays the exchange name and unique identifiers for deal creation and spend tracking.

### ✅ Exchange-Specific Seat Filtering
Campaign managers can filter seat information by specific exchanges (Google Ad Manager, Amazon Publisher Services, etc.) with dynamic updates and pagination support for accounts with many seat allocations.

### ✅ Seat Information Synchronization
Seat information automatically syncs with Amazon DSP when users access the DSP section, with visual indicators showing last sync time and highlighting changes since the last visit.

The Amazon DSP advertiser seats feature is now complete and production-ready, providing users with comprehensive visibility and management capabilities for their programmatic advertising seat allocations.
