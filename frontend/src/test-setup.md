# Dashboard Implementation Test Setup

## Environment Configuration

1. Update `.env.local` with your Clerk publishable key:
   ```
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your-clerk-publishable-key-here
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

2. Ensure the backend API is running on port 8000

## Testing Checklist

### Authentication Flow
- [ ] Sign-in page loads correctly at `/sign-in`
- [ ] Clerk authentication works (you can create a test account)
- [ ] Successful authentication redirects to `/dashboard`
- [ ] Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/sign-in`
- [ ] Sign-out functionality works from profile dropdown

### Dashboard Components
- [ ] Dashboard header displays with logo, navigation, and profile
- [ ] Account switcher component renders (even with mock data)
- [ ] Stats cards display with skeleton loading states
- [ ] Connection status indicator shows in header
- [ ] Theme toggle works (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Profile dropdown shows user information

### Navigation
- [ ] Dashboard, Accounts, Settings navigation works
- [ ] Mobile navigation menu toggles correctly

### UI/UX
- [ ] Purple theme is applied correctly
- [ ] Desktop-first responsive design works

- [ ] Toast notifications work

### API Integration
- [ ] Dashboard API service attempts to fetch data
- [ ] Error handling works when API is unavailable
- [ ] Connection status checks backend health endpoint

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:5173` and test the authentication flow

## Notes

- The dashboard uses mock data for demonstration
- Real API integration requires backend endpoints
- Clerk configuration is required for authentication to work
- All shadcn/ui components follow accessibility standards
