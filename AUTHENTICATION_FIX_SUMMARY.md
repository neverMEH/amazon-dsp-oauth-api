# Authentication and Database Sync Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **User ID Mismatch**: The `get_user_context` function was incorrectly mapping `user_id` to the Clerk user ID (e.g., `user_32fFuzeSeuB4IHRpjpotMlgywMf`) instead of the database UUID (e.g., `52a86382-266b-4004-bfd9-6bd6a64026eb`)

2. **Database Query Failures**: All Supabase queries were failing because they were using the wrong user ID format

3. **Missing Database Tables**: The `user_accounts` table and `user_id` column in `oauth_tokens` table don't exist because migrations haven't been run

4. **API Method Issues**: The Supabase Python client doesn't have a `maybe_single()` method

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed `get_user_context` Function
**File**: `/backend/app/middleware/clerk_auth.py`
- Modified to properly extract the database UUID from the authenticated user data
- Now correctly maps `user_id` to the database UUID instead of Clerk ID
- Preserves `clerk_user_id` separately for Clerk-specific operations

### 2. Updated API Endpoints
**Files**:
- `/backend/app/api/v1/settings.py`
- `/backend/app/api/v1/accounts.py`

Changes:
- Added proper error handling for missing users
- Added automatic user creation if user doesn't exist in database
- Fixed Supabase query methods (replaced `maybe_single()` with proper error handling)
- Added validation to ensure database user ID exists before queries

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added logging for failed user synchronization
- Improved error messages for missing database users
- Added fallback user creation in settings endpoint

## Required Database Migrations

**IMPORTANT**: The following migrations need to be run on your Supabase database:

1. **001_create_user_tables.sql**
   - Creates `users` table for storing Clerk user data
   - Creates `user_accounts` table for Amazon account connections
   - Adds `user_id` column to `oauth_tokens` table
   - Sets up proper foreign key relationships

2. **002_create_user_settings_table.sql**
   - Creates `user_settings` table for user preferences
   - Sets up proper indexes and constraints

### How to Run Migrations

1. **Via Supabase Dashboard**:
   ```
   1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   2. Navigate to SQL Editor
   3. Copy and paste each migration file content
   4. Execute in order (001 first, then 002)
   ```

2. **Via psql or PostgreSQL client**:
   ```bash
   psql YOUR_DATABASE_URL < migrations/001_create_user_tables.sql
   psql YOUR_DATABASE_URL < migrations/002_create_user_settings_table.sql
   ```

## Testing

A test script has been created at `/backend/test_auth_fix.py` to verify:
- User context mapping is correct
- Database queries work with proper user IDs
- User synchronization between Clerk and database

Run the test:
```bash
cd backend
python3 test_auth_fix.py
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the database migrations** (most critical)
2. Restart the backend server to apply all changes
3. Test the authentication flow with a real Clerk session
4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues

## Key Changes Summary

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `get_user_context` | `user_id` = Clerk ID | `user_id` = Database UUID |
| Settings API | No user creation | Auto-creates missing users |
| Accounts API | Direct user_id access | Validates user_id exists |
| Error Handling | Generic errors | Specific user sync errors |
| Database Queries | Using Clerk ID | Using Database UUID |

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/app/middleware/clerk_auth.py` - Fixed user context mapping
2. `/backend/app/api/v1/settings.py` - Fixed user queries and error handling
3. `/backend/app/api/v1/accounts.py` - Added user validation
4. Created `/backend/test_auth_fix.py` - Test script
5. Created `/backend/run_migrations.py` - Migration helper script

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. User logs in with Clerk authentication
2. Middleware creates/finds user in database with proper UUID
3. API endpoints receive correct database user ID
4. All database queries work with the UUID
5. User settings, accounts, and tokens are properly associated
